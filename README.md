# EXPLOITING-SERVER-VULNERABILITIES
Internship Project ( CYBER SECURITY )

In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding and exploiting server vulnerabilities is a crucial aspect of securing networks and systems.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental communication protocol used for the transmission of electronic mail.

This project focuses on the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities within SMTP servers, specifically targeting potential open relay configurations.


Metasploit Framework Usage:

The Metasploit Framework is employed to carry out vulnerability assessments on SMTP servers.

The module used, auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_relay, is designed for detecting SMTP Open Relay vulnerabilities.

An open relay misconfiguration could allow unauthorized users to use the server to send emails, potentially leading to abuse, spam, or even unauthorized access to sensitive information.


Key Steps:


Initialization:

Launch the Metasploit Framework using the msfconsole command.

Select the appropriate module with use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_relay.


Configuration:

Set the target host(s) using the set RHOSTS <target> command.

Configure other necessary options such as sender and recipient email addresses.


Execution:

Run the module with the run command to initiate the vulnerability scan.


Results:

Analyze the output to determine if the SMTP server is vulnerable to open relay attacks.

The results will indicate whether an open relay was detected on the specified SMTP server.


Project Objectives:

Identification of Open Relay Vulnerabilities:

Evaluate the target SMTP server to identify misconfigurations that might allow unauthorized relay of emails.


Mitigation Recommendations:

Provide recommendations to address and mitigate identified vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security posture of the SMTP server.


Educational Component:

Develop documentation and educational materials to raise awareness about SMTP server vulnerabilities and the importance of securing email infrastructure.


Demonstration of Exploitation Risks:

Illustrate the potential risks associated with open relay vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for prompt remediation.


Reporting:

Generate comprehensive reports detailing the findings, vulnerabilities, and recommended remediation steps.

By actively engaging in the identification and exploitation of SMTP server vulnerabilities, this project aims to contribute to the broader cybersecurity community's knowledge base and promote best practices for securing email communication infrastructure.
